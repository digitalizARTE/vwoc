--------------------------
Installing InvaderBot
--------------------------

You need three things to run InvaderBot:

1. The InvaderBot script (InvaderBot.AHK) and image resources

2. AutoHotKey  -- Download and install from: https://autohotkey.com/download/ 

3. Capture2Text -- Download from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/capture2text/files/Capture2Text/
		   Extract it into the folder containing the InvaderBot.AHK script

--------------------------
Running InvaderBot
--------------------------

Double-click InvadeBot.AHK to run InvaderBot

--------------------------
Using InvaderBot
--------------------------

CTRL+click on an invader to auto-attack.  

Press ESC to exit InvaderBot. 

*** You will probably need to update the sustained attack bonus value in InvaderBot.ahk to suite your Hero.

Note: InvaderBot only works on invaders you can see without scrolling.

Warning: Moving your mouse or clicking while InvaderBot is running will disturb InvaderBot. Set AutoHotKey.exe to run as administrator if you want to prevent this (see tips section below).

--------------------------
Tips
--------------------------

1. Set AutoHotKey to run as administrator to prevent accidental mouse movement:

AutoHotKey.exe by default is located in "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey". Right-click on AutoHotKey.exe, select Properties, click the Compatability tab, check the box labelled "Run this program as an administrator" and click "OK".

2. Minimum recommended window height is 1100 pixels. For example, if you run at 1900x1200 resolution, you should maximize your browser window while running InvaderBot. Running InvaderBot below this resolution may cause the in-game pop-ups to interfere with InvaderBot.

3. InvaderBot uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read values from the screen. This means the game window has to be visible in order for InvaderBot to work. 

4. InvaderBot uses image recognition to detect parts of the game screen. This means you must run the game at 100% zoom factor in your browser. Running with any other zoom factor will cause InvaderBot to malfunction.

5. If you exit InvaderBot (ESC) or InvaderBot gets confused and bails out, you will need to re-run InvaderBot by double-clicking InvaderBot.AHK
